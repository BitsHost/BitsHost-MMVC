Rasmus Lerdorf: PHP Frameworks all suck!

MMVC - MODULAR MMVC
Preambul - most current frameworks do everything except what you really need.
They add so many layers of abstractisation that you have to learn each time you change your framework another 
skills and paths.
They also add all the time so much useless option and resolve simple problems in a very complicated way.
They add, even PHP is already a template engine, other like blade. If PHP already does that why would you add another
template engine?
Usually when you try to conquer a new framework you have to relearn so many things and you are going so far from what
you already know about PHP.
Why MMVC?

Because it brings so much order in your life, it's simple, and because of modularity is very usefull for manageing
and develop.
You cand work to a module without any problem for the whole project. You can also exchange and import modules very simple
and fast.

Next, one of the best thing is that you can create your own module in your preffered language - PHP, JS, PYTHON or using
modern tools such as TS, React and so on. There are no limits to what you can do.
We made it with developemnt in mind. 
You can go in anydirections you want, how you want, you can use your own autoloader or composer autoload.
You can use composer/packagist but this is not mandatory.
But THE BEST thing is you cand work and use the full Latest PHP POWER with no limits. Without repeating things
in loop because this is all your Framework can do.

abilities and routes.

Additionally, they constantly add a ton of unnecessary options and handle straightforward issues in a convoluted manner.
As they point out, PHP functions as a template engine on its own, much like Blade. Why add another if PHP can already do that?
engine template?
Typically, when you attempt to master a new framework, you have to relearn a great deal and go far from what
PHP is already familiar to you.

What makes MMVC?

It's simple, so much order is brought into your life, and its versatility makes it incredibly helpful for development and management.
For the duration of the project, you can work to a module without any issues. Additionally, modules can be imported and exchanged quickly and easily.
The ability to write your own module in your preferred language (PHP, JS, or Python) or with contemporary technologies (TS, React, and so on) is the next best thing. Your capabilities are boundless.
Our goal when creating it was development. 

You are free to utilize composer autoload or your own autoloader, and you can move in any way you like.
Composer/packagist can be used, although it's not required.
The fact that you may utilize all of the latest PHP power without any restrictions is THE BEST thing, though. Since this is the only thing your Framework can do, avoid doing the same thing repeatedly.

They add so many layers of abstraction that you have to acquire new skills and paths every time you change your framework.
They also constantly add worthless options and handle simple problems in extremely convoluted ways.
They note that PHP, like blade, is already a template engine. Why would you introduce another template engine if PHP already does that?
When you try to master a new framework, you usually have to relearn a lot of stuff and go much beyond what you already know about PHP.
Why the MMVC?

Because it provides so much structure into your life, it's straightforward, and its versatility makes it extremely valuable for managing and developing.

Introducing MODULAR MMVC - Empowering Your Development

In the realm of modern frameworks, it often feels like they do everything except what truly matters. These frameworks tend to add layers of abstraction that demand you to learn new skills and pathways whenever you decide to switch. They also tend to clutter themselves with superfluous options, solving simple problems in needlessly convoluted ways. 

Consider PHP, including its blade templating engine. Why introduce yet another template engine when PHP is already equipped for the task? Delving into a new framework often necessitates a substantial relearning effort, pushing you far beyond your existing PHP knowledge.

So, why should you choose MMVC?

MMVC, standing for Modular Model View Controller, is not about reinventing the wheel. Instead, it's about optimizing the use of exceptional components. It offers a structured, straightforward approach, and its versatility proves invaluable for project management and development.

But why MMVC specifically?

1. **Modularity:** MMVC allows you to work on a module without impacting the rest of your project. Modules can be interchanged and integrated seamlessly, enhancing your development agility.

2. **Language Freedom:** Perhaps most importantly, you have the freedom to write your modules in your preferred language, whether it's PHP, JS, PYTHON, or modern technologies like TS and React. There are no constraints on your creativity.

3. **Development-Centric:** MMVC was designed with development in mind. You can steer your project in any direction you desire, utilizing your own autoloader or composer autoload. Composer/packagist usage is optional, not obligatory.

What truly sets MMVC apart is its ability to harness the latest PHP capabilities without constraint. No more endless loops, as this framework liberates your development possibilities.
